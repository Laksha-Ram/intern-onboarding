# Intern Onboarding
## Day - 1
Frontend vs Backend

Frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly, such as buttons, forms, and pages.
Backend handles the logic, data processing, and communication with databases and servers.

Request–Response Lifecycle

1. The browser sends a request to the server.
2. The server receives and processes the request.
3. The server sends a response back.
4. The browser displays the response to the user.

Example

When a user opens a website, the browser requests the page, the server processes it, and the response is shown as a webpage.

## Day 2 – JavaScript Basics

This script demonstrates core JavaScript fundamentals including variables,
functions, arrays, objects, error handling, and asynchronous programming
using promises and async/await.

## Day 3 – Node.js & Express Basics

What I built

A basic Express server with three GET endpoints to understand routes and request/response handling.

How to run

1. Install dependencies
   npm install
2. Start server
   node index.js
3. Open in browser
   http://localhost:3000

Endpoints

- GET /health
  - Purpose: simple health check to confirm server is running
  - Response: "Server is healthy 💚"

- GET /hello
  - Purpose: test route to return a greeting message
  - Response: "Hello from my first Express server 👋"

- GET /time
  - Purpose: return current server time
  - Response: "Current time is <time>"
