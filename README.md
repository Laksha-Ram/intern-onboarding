# Intern Onboarding
## Day - 1
Frontend vs Backend

Frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly, such as buttons, forms, and pages.
Backend handles the logic, data processing, and communication with databases and servers.

Request–Response Lifecycle

1. The browser sends a request to the server.
2. The server receives and processes the request.
3. The server sends a response back.
4. The browser displays the response to the user.

Example

When a user opens a website, the browser requests the page, the server processes it, and the response is shown as a webpage.
