# Intern Onboarding – Day 1

## Frontend vs Backend
Frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly, such as pages, buttons, and forms.
Backend handles server-side logic, data processing, and communication with databases.

## Request–Response Lifecycle
1. The browser sends a request to the server.
2. The server receives and processes the request.
3. The server sends a response back.
4. The browser displays the response to the user.

## Example
When a user opens a website, the browser requests the page, the server processes it, and the response is shown as a webpage.
