# Day 3 – Node.js & Express Basics

## What I built
A basic Express server with three GET endpoints to understand routes and request/response handling.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start server:
   node index.js
3. Open in browser:
   http://localhost:3000

## Endpoints
- GET /health – Health check
- GET /hello – Greeting message
- GET /time – Returns current server time
